   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
    And the continuance of their parents' rage
    Which but their children's end naught could remove
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage
